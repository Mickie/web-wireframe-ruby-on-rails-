    <h2>Mission</h2>
    <p>
      Fanzo connects sports fans, gives them a place to show off their passion for their teams and rewards 
      them… a place where they can find other crazy, sports-obsessed fans like themselves physically and virtually.

    <h2>How do fans rule?</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Create a custom fanzone and show off your pride. You're Joe the Michigan fan and everyone knows it 
        -- you know where all the watch sites are, can connect other fans when they move and travel, 
        have the coolest Michigan photo stream, loads of followers, and interact regularly with beat reporters... 
        everyone wants to join your Fanzone, in fact, you have more than 100,000 followers. Finally! 
        Joe is in fact the BEST Michigan fan out there and is getting recognized for it.
