          Anyone who watches ESPN knows how much Viagra & Cialis love sports fans.  
          Facebook login helps limit the number of users who will happily post the wonders of ED drugs
          or other types of spam on the site.

          We are all passionate about our teams, and love the charged discussions.  
          Sometimes, however, these can degrade into flame wars,
          and no-one enjoys that.  Too many awesome communities degrade into middle 
          school playgrounds because common social rules are easily averted
          through fake accounts. Facebook login helps keep the games clean.
